Git Diff:
` + diff + `

Please follow these Git commit message best practices:
- Subject line: 50-72 characters, summarize the change
- Leave a blank line after the subject
- Body: Detailed explanation, wrap lines at 72 characters
- Explain WHAT changed and WHY (not just how)

Format your response as follows:
Generated Commit Message:
[Subject line - 50-72 characters]

[Detailed body explaining the changes, wrapped at 72 characters.
Include context about what was changed and why it was necessary.
You can use multiple paragraphs if needed.]

Example output:
Generated Commit Message:
Add JWT-based user authentication system

Implement comprehensive authentication using JSON Web Tokens with
bcrypt password hashing for enhanced security. Add middleware for
protecting authenticated routes and validation for email/password
requirements.

Updates database schema to include user roles and timestamps for
better user management and audit trails.`
